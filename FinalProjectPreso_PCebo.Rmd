## ðŸ“± The Challenge

For the Johns Hopkins Data Science Capstone Project, the challenge was to build a **next word prediction (NLP) model, using R**. The aid with building the model, we were given a large data set of US English text (>550MB).

- **102 million-word training corpus** 
- Corpus comprised of twitter (X), news and blog - raw text data.

## ðŸ”§ The Innovative ðŸ’¡ Solution

The final model chosen  utilizes a 5-gram backoff algorithm with intelligent two-word chaining for and improved user experience. 

### How It Works

1. The model analyzes user input and extracts context (up to 4 words)
2. Attempts to match against 5-gram patterns (sequences of 5 words). This lookup is extremely fast thanks to implementation of hashing during the model building phase.
3. If no match is found, the model "backs off" to shorter n-grams (5â†’4â†’3â†’2â†’1)
4. To improve UI, if a prediction is a stopword, the model chains to predict the next word and gives a 2-word prediction.
5. Finally, the model returns top 3 most likely continuations to the user input

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

- **28.2% top-3 accuracy** on held-out test data (15% of corpus)
- **14.8 MB model size** - fits on any smartphone
- **~30ms median prediction time** - wait time is completely imperceptible to users
- **Smart two-word chaining** - e.g. predicts "the beach" instead of just "the"
- **102 million-word training corpus** - trained on twitter (X), news and blog text data in US English.

## ðŸš€ Demo
